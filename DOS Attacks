# Understanding DOS Attacks:

<h2>What is DOS.<br></h2>
Denial of Service attacks target computer systems and networks,  Attacker makes unnecessary requests to cause a disruption in the service provided . In blockchain " Denial of Service attack can significantly delay any contract'sfunctionality by making it very gas-intensive therefore, it is expensive to use" . 
<br> <br> 
If the function  exceeds the block gas limit, it causes the DOS to happen. When causing a function to not work properly as it intend to means that there is a DOS.

<h2>Some Important areas to look for Dos attacks. <br> </h2>

* 1.Unbounded For Loops (Indefinite iterations) (Unbounded = means It can grow up to any size)
* 2.External Calls
* 3.Return values

<h2>Areas where chances of bugs. <br> </h2>
- 1.External calls without gas stipends <br>
- 2.Looping through externally manipulated mappings or arrays <br>
- 3.Untrusted reverts.<br>
- 4. Calling a function that doesn't exist in the blockchain universe.

<h2>External calls:</h2> These can be anything from transferring ether to calling a third-party contract. Evaluate ways these external calls could fail, leading to an incomplete transaction.

<h2>Questions to ask?<br> </h2>

* Is the iterable entity bounded by size?
* Can a user append arbitrary items to the list?
* How much does it cost the user to do so?

<h2>Mitigation <br> </h2>
- Try to not make unbounded loops. <br>
- Check for every Scenerio
