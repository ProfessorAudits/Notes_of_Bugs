### Tips to find the issue :

- 1. Collect all the `external` or `public` functions.
- 2. See who can call the function (like : can anyone call it or onlyOwner)
- 3. Check who is intended to call that function.
- 4. Pay closer look where there is a lack of zero address check . how it can impact the protocol?

### Ask these questions to check who is intended to call the function:

 - 1.  What this function does?
 - 2. What is the Impact of this function on the protocol?
 - 3.  How the protocol could act if this function is not in the protocol ?
